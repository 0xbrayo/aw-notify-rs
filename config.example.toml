# aw-notify-rs Configuration File
#
# This is an example configuration file for aw-notify-rs.
# A default configuration file like this is automatically created at:
# - Linux: ~/.config/aw-notify/config.toml
# - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/aw-notify/config.toml
# - Windows: %APPDATA%\aw-notify\config.toml
#
# The configuration file is created automatically on first run.

# Enable or disable hourly activity summaries
hourly_checkins = true

# Enable or disable new day greeting notifications
new_day_greetings = true

# Enable or disable ActivityWatch server monitoring alerts
server_monitoring = true

# Category alerts configuration
# Each alert monitors a specific category and sends notifications when thresholds are reached
[[alerts]]
category = "All"                                    # Category to monitor (must match ActivityWatch categories)
label = "All"                                       # Display name in notifications
thresholds_minutes = [60, 120, 240, 360, 480]     # Thresholds: 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h
positive = false                                    # false = "Time spent" warnings, true = "Goal reached" achievements

[[alerts]]
category = "Twitter"
label = "🐦 Twitter"
thresholds_minutes = [15, 30, 60]                  # 15min, 30min, 1h warnings
positive = false

[[alerts]]
category = "Youtube"
label = "📺 Youtube"
thresholds_minutes = [15, 30, 60]                  # 15min, 30min, 1h warnings
positive = false

[[alerts]]
category = "Work"
label = "💼 Work"
thresholds_minutes = [15, 30, 60, 120, 240]       # 15min, 30min, 1h, 2h, 4h achievements
positive = true                                     # Show as "Goal reached!" instead of warnings

# Example: Social Media Alert
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Social Media"
# label = "📱 Social Media"
# thresholds_minutes = [30, 60, 120]
# positive = false

# Example: Programming Alert (positive reinforcement)
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Programming"
# label = "💻 Programming"
# thresholds_minutes = [30, 60, 120, 180, 240]
# positive = true

# Example: Nested Category Alert - Track specific subcategories
# Nested categories use " > " as separator (e.g., "Work > Programming > Rust")
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Work > Programming"
# label = "💻 Work Programming"
# thresholds_minutes = [60, 120, 180, 240]
# positive = true

# Example: Deep Nested Category - Track very specific activities
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Work > Programming > Rust"
# label = "🦀 Rust Development"
# thresholds_minutes = [30, 60, 90, 120]
# positive = true

# Example: Another Nested Category - Meetings
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Work > Meetings"
# label = "📅 Meetings"
# thresholds_minutes = [30, 60, 120]
# positive = false

# Example: Custom category with emoji
# [[alerts]]
# category = "Gaming"
# label = "🎮 Gaming"
# thresholds_minutes = [60, 120, 180]
# positive = false

# Notes:
# - Categories must match exactly what ActivityWatch reports
# - Nested categories are fully supported using " > " separator (e.g., "Work > Programming > Rust")
# - You can set alerts for both top-level categories (e.g., "Work") and nested categories (e.g., "Work > Programming")
# - Threshold alerts use the full category hierarchy, so nested categories will be matched exactly
# - Hourly checkins show top-level categories only for a clean summary
# - Use positive=true for activities you want to encourage (shows "Goal reached!")
# - Use positive=false for activities you want to limit (shows "Time spent")
# - Thresholds are in minutes and will trigger notifications when reached
# - Labels support emoji and will be shown in notification titles
# - You can have as many alerts as you want by adding more [[alerts]] sections
